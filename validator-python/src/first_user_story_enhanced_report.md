### Complete Technical Requirements

#### Technical Requirement 1

1. **Architecture Considerations**: The system must integrate IMS DB, DB2, and MQ for real-time processing of credit card authorization requests. It should ensure transactional consistency using two-phase commit transactions across IMS DB and DB2.

2. **Involved Modules/Classes**: 
   - COPAUA0C: Handles authorization request processing triggered by MQ messages.
   - COPAUS0C: Displays authorization summary.
   - COPAUS1C: Displays authorization details.
   - COPAUS2C: Marks transactions as fraudulent and updates DB2.
   - CBPAUP0C: Purges expired authorizations.

3. **Relevant Interfaces or Methods**: 
   - MQ queues for request and response: AWS.M2.CARDDEMO.PAUTH.REQUEST and AWS.M2.CARDDEMO.PAUTH.REPLY.
   - COBOL BMS screens for user interaction: Authorization Request Screen.
   - CICS transactions: CP00, CPVS, CPVD.

4. **Database Schema Changes**: 
   - AUTHFRDS table in DB2 to store authorization and fraud-related data.
   - PA_AUTHORIZATION_DETAILS segment in IMS DB for hierarchical storage of authorization details.

5. **Validations**: 
   - Validate credit card number format and length.
   - Ensure transaction amount is within permissible limits.
   - Check for expired cards and invalid authorization types.
   - Detect potential fraud using predefined rules.

6. **Integration Points**: 
   - MQ for asynchronous communication.
   - IMS DB for hierarchical data storage.
   - DB2 for relational data storage and fraud analytics.

7. **Error Handling**: 
   - Return error messages for invalid credit card numbers.
   - Provide reasons for declined transactions.
   - Flag transactions for review in case of suspected fraud.

8. **Audit Logging**: 
   - Log all transactions in DB2 for audit purposes.

9. **Transactional Consistency**: 
   - Ensure two-phase commit transactions across IMS DB and DB2.

10. **User Interface**: 
    - Provide screens for submitting authorization requests and viewing authorization details.
