- **Security:** Fraud detection and audit logging
- **Mainframe Integration:** Proper use of IMS, DB2, and CICS

### Technical Considerations:

- **Complexity:** Dual database architecture requires careful transaction management
- **Performance:** Real-time processing with fraud detection
- **Maintenance:** Multiple COBOL programs need coordinated updates
- **Testing:** Complex integration points require comprehensive testing

**Note:** These assessments are based on requirements analysis only and have not been validated against actual implementation.

## DeepEval Validation Recommendations

### Phase 1 - High Priority Validations:

1. **Validate Parsed Technical Requirements** against actual system architecture and implementation
2. **Validate Architecture Components** against actual technologies in the codebase
3. **Validate Integration Points** against actual system interfaces and connections

### Phase 2 - Medium Priority Validations:

4. **Cross-reference Data Entities** with actual database schema and table structures
5. **Verify Technical Validation Rules** against actual validation logic in code
6. **Validate Implementation Modules** against actual COBOL programs in the codebase

### Phase 3 - Detailed Validations:

7. **Verify Error Handling** against actual error handling mechanisms
8. **Validate Audit Logging** against actual logging implementations
9. **Validate Transactional Consistency** against actual two-phase commit implementations

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure:

1. Set up MQ queues and CICS transactions
2. Implement basic COBOL programs (COPAUA0C, COPAUS0C)
3. Create database schemas (AUTHFRDS, PA_AUTHORIZATION_DETAILS)

### Phase 2 - Business Logic:

1. Implement validation rules
2. Add fraud detection logic
3. Create BMS screens for user interface

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features:

1. Implement two-phase commit transactions
2. Add audit logging and reporting
3. Performance optimization and monitoring

**Note:** These recommendations are based on requirements analysis and should be validated against actual implementation constraints.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk:

- Two-phase commit complexity
- Real-time fraud detection performance
- Integration between IMS and DB2

### Medium Risk:

- MQ message handling
- COBOL program coordination
- Data validation rules

### Low Risk:

- BMS screen development
- Basic CRUD operations
- Audit logging implementation

**Note:** Risk assessment is based on requirements analysis and should be validated against actual implementation.

## Performance Considerations

### Throughput Requirements:

- Real-time processing of authorization requests
- Concurrent access to IMS and DB2 databases
- MQ message processing capacity

### Scalability Factors:

- MQ queue sizing and management
- Database connection pooling
- CICS transaction limits

## Next Steps for Validation

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Feed Parsed Technical Requirements to DeepEval** for validation against actual system architecture
2. **Validate Architecture Components** against actual technologies used
3. **Cross-reference Integration Points** with actual system interfaces
4. **Verify Data Entities** against actual database schema
5. **Validate Technical Validation Rules** against actual validation logic

### Validation Success Criteria:

- ✅ Parsed technical requirements align with actual system architecture
- ✅ Architecture components correspond to actual technologies used
- ✅ Integration points match actual system interfaces
- ✅ Data entities align with actual database schema
- ✅ Technical validation rules match actual validation logic in code
