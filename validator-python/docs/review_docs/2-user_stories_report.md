## Ready for DeepEval Validation

The following analyzable objects are ready to be fed into DeepEval for validation:

#### **1. Business Rules (9 rules) - HIGH PRIORITY**

```json
"business_rules": [
  "The credit card number must be 16 digits and numeric.",
  "The transaction amount must be a positive decimal value.",
  "Authorization requests must include a valid card expiry date in MMYY format.",
  "Fraud detection rules must be applied to all authorization requests.",
  "Authorization requests must be processed in real-time using MQ.",
  "All approved transactions must be stored in the IMS database.",
  "All declined transactions must include a reason code.",
  "The system must ensure two-phase commit transactions across IMS DB and DB2.",
  "Authorization requests must be logged for audit purposes."
]
```

**Note:** Business rules belong to user stories and define business logic and constraints. They should be validated against actual COBOL validation logic and database constraints.

#### **2. Categorized Business Rules - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

```json
"validation_rules": [
  "The credit card number must be 16 digits and numeric.",
  "The transaction amount must be a positive decimal value.",
  "Fraud detection rules must be applied to all authorization requests.",
  "Authorization requests must be processed in real-time using MQ.",
  "All approved transactions must be stored in the IMS database.",
  "The system must ensure two-phase commit transactions across IMS DB and DB2.",
  "Authorization requests must be logged for audit purposes."
],
"process_rules": [
  "All declined transactions must include a reason code."
],
"security_rules": [
  "Authorization requests must include a valid card expiry date in MMYY format."
]
```

#### **3. Feature Analysis - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

```json
"feature_name": "Credit Card Authorizations",
"feature_category": "Transaction Processing",
"related_features": [
  "As a user, I want to view detailed authorization information, so that I can verify transaction details and statuses.",
  "As a user, I want to mark suspicious transactions as fraudulent, so that potential fraud can be flagged and reported.",
  "As a user, I want to navigate through multiple authorizations, so that I can efficiently manage transaction records.",
  "As a user, I want to purge expired authorizations, so that outdated data is removed from the system.",
  "As a system, I want to validate authorization requests, so that only legitimate transactions are processed.",
  "As a system, I want to apply business rules to authorization requests, so that transactions comply with predefined policies.",
  "As a system, I want to detect and report fraudulent transactions, so that fraud analytics can be performed.",
  "As a system, I want to store authorization details in IMS DB, so that transaction data is securely maintained.",
  "As a system, I want to perform batch processing of expired authorizations, so that system resources are optimized."
]
```

#### **4. Priority Analysis - LOW PRIORITY**

```json
"priority": "",
"story_points": "",
"business_value": "Not specified",
"effort_estimate": "Not specified"
```

## Business Rules Analysis

### Total Rules: 9

**Validation Status:** ❌ **NOT VALIDATED** - Only extracted and categorized

#### Categorized Rules:

1. **Validation Rules (7):**

   - Credit card number must be 16 digits and numeric
   - Transaction amount must be positive decimal value
   - Fraud detection rules must be applied
   - Real-time processing using MQ
   - Approved transactions stored in IMS database
   - Two-phase commit transactions across IMS DB and DB2
   - Authorization requests logged for audit

2. **Process Rules (1):**

   - Declined transactions must include reason code

3. **Security Rules (1):**
   - Valid card expiry date in MMYY format

### Validation Focus

8 out of 9 rules are validation-focused, indicating strong emphasis on data validation and process control.

**Validation Status:** ❌ **NOT VALIDATED** - Only categorized by type

## Feature Analysis

### Related Features (9 found):

1. View detailed authorization information
2. Mark suspicious transactions as fraudulent
3. Navigate through multiple authorizations
4. Purge expired authorizations
5. Validate authorization requests
6. Apply business rules to authorization requests
7. Detect and report fraudulent transactions
8. Store authorization details in IMS DB
9. Perform batch processing of expired authorizations

**Validation Status:** ❌ **NOT VALIDATED** - Only identified from requirements text

## DeepEval Validation Recommendations

### Phase 1 - High Priority Validations:

1. **Validate Business Rules** against actual COBOL validation logic and database constraints
2. **Validate Feature Relationships** against actual system functionality and user workflows
3. **Validate Business Rule Categories** against actual implementation patterns

### Phase 2 - Medium Priority Validations:

4. **Cross-reference Related Features** with actual system capabilities and user stories
5. **Validate Feature Categories** against actual system architecture and business domains
6. **Verify Business Rule Dependencies** against actual system integration points

### Phase 3 - Detailed Validations:

7. **Validate Validation Rules** against actual data validation logic in code
8. **Verify Process Rules** against actual business process implementations
9. **Validate Security Rules** against actual security mechanisms and controls

## Key Insights

### Strengths:

- Comprehensive business rules covering validation, security, and process requirements
- Clear integration with mainframe technologies (IMS, DB2, MQ)
- Strong focus on fraud detection and audit logging
- Real-time processing requirements clearly defined

**Note:** These insights are based on requirements analysis only and have not been validated against actual implementation.

### Areas for Improvement:

- No acceptance criteria defined
- Priority and story points not specified
- Could benefit from more detailed acceptance criteria for testing

**Note:** These areas for improvement are based on requirements analysis and should be validated against actual business needs.

### Architecture Alignment:

- Well-aligned with mainframe modernization patterns
- Proper use of two-phase commit for data consistency
- Good separation of concerns between IMS and DB2

**Note:** Architecture alignment assessment is based on requirements analysis and should be validated against actual implementation.

## Recommendations

1. **Add Acceptance Criteria:** Define specific, testable acceptance criteria
2. **Set Priorities:** Establish business priority and effort estimates
3. **Enhance Testing:** Create test scenarios based on business rules
4. **Document Dependencies:** Clarify relationships with related features

**Note:** These recommendations are based on requirements analysis and should be validated against actual implementation constraints.

## Next Steps for Validation

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Feed Business Rules to DeepEval** for validation against actual COBOL validation logic
2. **Validate Feature Relationships** against actual system functionality
3. **Cross-reference Business Rule Categories** with actual implementation patterns
4. **Verify Related Features** against actual system capabilities
5. **Validate Feature Categories** against actual business domains

### Validation Success Criteria:

- ✅ Business rules align with actual COBOL validation logic
- ✅ Feature relationships correspond to actual system functionality
- ✅ Business rule categories match actual implementation patterns
- ✅ Related features align with actual system capabilities
- ✅ Feature categories correspond to actual business domains
